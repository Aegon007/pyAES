# pyAES
This is a pure implementation of AES algorithm with python language

For now, I only let it run one round, I plan to make it fully run 10 round latter

And I also have a bigger plan, I want to extend it to a android/ios app to help
us to encrypt our conversion while we are using Internet-based message apps


if you have any questions, please contact me.
